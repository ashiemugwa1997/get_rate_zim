# ZimRate Predictor

## Overview
ZimRate Predictor is a Django-based web application that forecasts the Zimbabwe Dollar (ZWL) to USD exchange rate based on social media announcements, news articles, and statements from key financial figures. The system analyzes sentiment and content from various sources to predict market movements and exchange rate fluctuations.

## Features
- Real-time monitoring of key social media accounts
- News article scraping and analysis
- Natural language processing for sentiment analysis
- Exchange rate prediction model
- Historical data tracking and analysis
- Interactive web dashboard for trend visualization
- User authentication and personalized alerts
- REST API for external access to predictions

## Getting Started

### Prerequisites
- Python 3.8+
- Django 4.0+
- Internet connection for API access
- API keys for social media platforms and news sources

### Installation
```bash
# Clone the repository
git clone https://github.com/yourusername/get_rate_zim.git
cd get_rate_zim

# Create and activate virtual environment (optional but recommended)
python -m venv venv
# On Windows:
venv\Scripts\activate
# On Unix/macOS:
# source venv/bin/activate

# Install requirements
pip install -r requirements.txt

# Run migrations
python manage.py migrate

# Create superuser
python manage.py createsuperuser
```

### Configuration
1. Create a `.env` file with your API keys and Django settings:
```
SECRET_KEY=your_django_secret_key
DEBUG=True
TWITTER_API_KEY=your_twitter_api_key
NEWS_API_KEY=your_news_api_key
DJANGO_ALLOWED_HOSTS=localhost,127.0.0.1
```

2. Configure source accounts and keywords in the admin interface

## Usage
Run the development server:
```bash
python manage.py runserver
```

Access the application at http://127.0.0.1:8000/

## Project Structure
- `get_rate_zim/` - Django project settings
- `rate_predictor/` - Main Django application
  - `models.py` - Database models for storing rates and predictions
  - `views.py` - View controllers for web interface
  - `api.py` - REST API endpoints
- `scrapers/` - Modules for collecting data from various sources
- `analysis/` - Sentiment analysis and text processing modules
- `prediction/` - Machine learning models for prediction
- `static/` - CSS, JavaScript, and other static files
- `templates/` - HTML templates
- `manage.py` - Django management script

## How It Works
1. Data Collection: Scheduled tasks scrape tweets, news articles, and statements from configured sources
2. Text Processing: Django background workers extract relevant information and perform sentiment analysis
3. Feature Engineering: Raw data is transformed into model-ready features
4. Prediction: Django ORM stores predictions generated by trained models
5. Visualization: Django templates render interactive dashboards with real-time predictions

## Development
Run tests with:
```bash
python manage.py test
```
